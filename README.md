CMPE-460: Interface and Digital Electronics LaTeX Lab Report Template

This is a lab report template in LaTeX for Interface and Digital Electronics. I have tried to make it as simple as possible to use (AKA tons of comments), so I hope this is a good way for newcomers to learn and meddle around with this amazing technology. 

INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE AND/OR SET UP LATEX AND AN EDITOR:

I. For people who already have LaTeX set up with an editor:
  1. Download the .zip file.
  2. Extract all files and folders into your desired location.
  3. Run the ide_lab_report.tex file.
  
II. For people who have not set up LaTeX:
  1. Download a LaTeX distribution. MiKTeX for Windows, MacTeX for MacOS, and TeX Live for Linux shall suffice.
  2. Install an editor. TeXStudio is awesome AND it is on Windows, Mac, and Linux. You can also use an online site called OverLeaf which lets you save, edit, and compile real-time into .PDF as you edit. The only problem is that it does not have a lot of space, so it can fill up fairly quickly.
  3. Now you have LaTeX and an editor set up! Follow Section I above for the rest of the instructions.
  
  Happy Lab Writing! Hope this helps!
